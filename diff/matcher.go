package diff

// This package implements a sequence matcher based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm.
// It provides functionality to compare two sequences and generate operation codes that describe
// the differences between them.
//
// The algorithm used is a variant of the Myers diff algorithm with dynamic programming optimization,
// similar to what's implemented in Python's difflib and other diff utilities.

// OpCode represents a single operation in the difference between two sequences.
// Each OpCode describes how to transform a portion of sequence A into a portion of sequence B.
type OpCode struct {
	// Tag describes the type of operation:
	// 'e' = equal (sequences match)
	// 'd' = delete (remove from sequence A)
	// 'i' = insert (add to sequence B)
	// 'r' = replace (substitute portion of A with portion of B)
	Tag byte

	// I1, I2 define the range [I1:I2) in sequence A
	I1, I2 int

	// J1, J2 define the range [J1:J2) in sequence B
	J1, J2 int
}

// Matcher compares two sequences of strings and computes the differences between them.
// It uses a dynamic programming approach based on the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm
// to find the optimal alignment between the sequences.
//
// The matcher is designed to be compatible with the interface used by go-difflib,
// specifically providing the GetOpCodes() method that returns operation codes.

// NewMatcher creates a new Matcher to compare two sequences of strings.
//
// Parameters:
//   - a: The first sequence (often considered the "original")
//   - b: The second sequence (often considered the "modified")
//
// Returns:
//   - A new Matcher instance ready to compute differences
//
// Example:
//
//	original := []string{"hello", " ", "world"}
//	modified := []string{"hello", " ", "universe"}
//	matcher := NewMatcher(original, modified)
//	opcodes := matcher.GetOpCodes()

// GetOpCodes returns a slice of OpCode structs describing the differences between
// the two sequences. Each OpCode represents one operation needed to transform
// sequence A into sequence B.
//
// The algorithm works in two phases:
// 1. Compute the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) using dynamic programming
// 2. Trace back through the LCS table to generate operation codes
//
// Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m and n are the lengths of the sequences
// Space Complexity: O(m*n) for the DP table, O(min(m,n)) for the result
//
// Returns:
//   - A slice of OpCode structs, each describing a single edit operation
//   - Operations are returned in order from the beginning of the sequences

//
// The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table where dp[i][j]
// represents the length of the LCS of a[0:i] and b[0:j].
//
// After building the DP table, we trace back from dp[len(a)][len(b)] to dp[0][0]
// to reconstruct the sequence of operations that transform sequence A into B.
//
// The traceback process:
//   - If a[i-1] == b[j-1]: both sequences have the same element (EQUAL)
//   - If dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]: delete from A (DELETE)
//   - Otherwise: insert into A (INSERT)
//   - Special case: when we have both deletions and insertions in the same region,
//     we merge them into a REPLACE operation for efficiency
